# Fokus



Fokus is a productivity tool inspired by the Pomodoro technique, designed to enhance focus on important tasks. The concept revolves around concentrated work intervals of 25 minutes followed by short breaks, with the option of taking a longer 15-minute break after completing a set of intervals.

Users can seamlessly switch between timers to effectively manage their time, ensuring optimal productivity and concentration. Fokus empowers users to streamline their workflow, maintain focus, and achieve their goals efficiently by providing a simple and intuitive interface for time management.
